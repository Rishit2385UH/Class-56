            Tim Berners Lee is a software engineer who invented the internet (world wide web) in 1989 at CERN, the European Particle Physics Lab. He is the directior of world wide web consortium that he founded and a professor in the Computer Science Dept. at the Oxford University. <br> In 2001, he became a Fellow of the Royall Society and in 2004, he was knighted. <br>In 1994, Berners Lee founded the world wide web consortium at the lab of Comp. Sci. (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It was made up of companies that wanted to work together to create web standards and also improve the web. It was quickly agreed that the technology should be free of royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this www since it was founded. <br>In 1995 Microsoft produced the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial browser created enormous growth in websites and web users. The Web was first used for e-commerce in 1997.</p>
